Guidelines on use of data in publications (copyright and licensing)
It is a condition of our funding from NIH and Wellcome that the nomenclature and information we provide is freely available to all. Anyone may use the HGNC data, but we request that they reference the "HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee at the European Bioinformatics Institute" and the website URL where possible.
